Computer Vision Toolkit (CVT)

by Andrea Fusiello, 2018

This toolkit is a collection of Matlab function implementing
several Computer Vision algorithms.


SETUP: cd to the main directory of CVT, where the file
cvt_setup.m is and run: "cvt_setup". This will add the relevant
folders to the search path.

The main directory containing the relevant function is "m-files".
Its content will be displayed by "cvt_setup".

This code runs indifferently on Octave and Matlab. It has been
tested on Octave 4.2.1 and Matlab R2017a. It does not have any
external dependency on toolboxes or packages.

The "test" directory contains scripts that test (mostly) all the
functions in the toolkit.  After setup cd to "test" and
run "testAll". This will call all the test scripts report
coverage.

The "m-files/aux" directory contains auxiliary, helper functions. 

The "thirdparty" directory contains auxiliary, helper functions
from other authors, in which case the respective copyright
notices apply.

The directory "cherubino12" contains 12 JPEG images of a statue,
together with camera matrices (.pm) and masks (.png) (curtesy of
3Dflow srl).  They are used in the testIMG ad testCARVE scripts.

The functions in this toolkit are described in the book:

	Fusiello, A. "Visione computazionale. Tecniche di
	ricostruzione tridimensionale."  Franco Angeli, Milano,
	2018, 2a ed.

Unfortunately the book is written in italian, although the
functions are documented in english.
